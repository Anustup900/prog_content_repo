{"prompt": "An image of a woman standing indoors in a modern, minimalist living space with light wooden flooring. She is taking a mirror selfie with her phone held in her right hand, partially covering her face. Her pose is relaxed and casual, with her left hand in the pocket of her loose-fitting white drawstring pants. She is wearing a fitted, short-sleeved brown t-shirt that accentuates her figure. On her feet, she has white open-toe sandals with a crisscross design. She accessorizes with a small brown shoulder bag with tan straps, worn on her right shoulder, and a delicate bracelet on her right wrist. Her long, straight hair is parted slightly off-center and falls over her shoulders. The background features a white sofa with textured cushions, a glass coffee table with a metal frame, a black small dog standing near the sofa, and a dining area with a round glass table and white upholstered chairs. The wall behind her is white with a large piece of abstract marble-patterned art or backsplash visible near the dining area. The overall ambiance is clean, contemporary, and cozy.", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "seed": 60698657, "faceDetailerSeed": 42913361, "upscaling_time": 30.020619869232178}
