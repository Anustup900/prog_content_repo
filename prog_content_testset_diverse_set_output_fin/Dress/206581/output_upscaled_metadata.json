{"prompt": "An image of a woman standing outdoors in front of a white wooden building with two windows. She has long, wavy, light auburn hair cascading over her shoulders. She is smiling warmly and looking directly at the camera. She is wearing a black mini dress with a delicate white floral pattern, featuring a sweetheart neckline and three-quarter puffed sleeves with elastic cuffs. The dress has a gathered, slightly flared skirt that ends mid-thigh. On her feet, she wears knee-high, light beige cowboy boots with subtle embroidered detailing. She accessorizes with a thin, delicate necklace around her neck. The background includes a patch of green grass and a gravel edge near the pavement where she stands, creating a casual yet charming rural setting. Her pose is relaxed and confident, with one leg slightly bent and one hand gently touching the side of her dress.", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "seed": 42862058, "faceDetailerSeed": 4618864, "upscaling_time": 30.29828667640686}
