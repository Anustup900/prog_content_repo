{"prompt": "An image of a woman standing indoors against a textured white wall with an arched opening and a large rustic stone planter containing broad green leaves. She is posed with one hand gently touching her neck and the other resting near her waist, her head slightly tilted and her gaze directed towards the camera, exuding a soft, contemplative expression. She wears a sheer, long-sleeved, floor-length dress adorned with delicate white polka dots and ruffled layers at the cuffs, waist, and hem, featuring a high slit in the front that reveals her legs. The dress has a nude underlayer that contrasts subtly with the translucent fabric. Her hair is styled in a loose, messy bun with wispy strands framing her face. She accessorizes with large, statement gold earrings that add a touch of elegance. On her feet, she wears nude, open-toe sandals with a simple strap design. The floor beneath her is decorated with intricate, patterned tiles in earthy tones, complementing the warm, muted ambiance of the setting.", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "seed": 54725563, "faceDetailerSeed": 16864884, "upscaling_time": 33.794567346572876}
