{"prompt": "An image of a woman standing indoors against a textured, worn beige wall with peeling paint, next to a rustic wooden table with metal legs. She is posing with one leg crossed over the other, leaning slightly back with her left hand resting on the table and her right hand holding a slim silver laptop. She has long, dark hair with soft waves and bangs, and is wearing black-framed glasses. Her outfit consists of a fitted, light blue pinstriped button-up shirt with flared cuffs and a small white embroidered design on the chest, partially unbuttoned to reveal a black lace camisole underneath. She pairs this with a short, asymmetrical gray skirt. On her legs, she wears knee-high gray ribbed socks, and on her feet, she has black pointed-toe high heels with multiple straps and a clear stiletto heel. She accessorizes with a silver pendant necklace and a black handbag with a chain strap placed on the table beside her. The overall atmosphere is casual yet stylish with a slightly edgy, vintage vibe.", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "seed": 51821313, "faceDetailerSeed": 75929034, "upscaling_time": 28.807327270507812}
