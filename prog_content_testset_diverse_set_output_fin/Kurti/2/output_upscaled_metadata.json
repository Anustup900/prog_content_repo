{"prompt": "An image of a woman standing outdoors on a wet concrete pathway beside a white wall with a black iron fence on top. She is posing with a slight lean to one side, her head tilted gently, and a soft smile on her face. Her right arm is relaxed by her side, and her left arm is slightly extended outward, holding a beige textured tote bag with fringed edges. She has shoulder-length black hair styled simply, and she wears a small bindi on her forehead. \n\nShe is dressed in a white tunic with three-quarter sleeves, featuring intricate red floral embroidery around the neckline, sleeve cuffs, and hem. The tunic has side slits, and a yellow flower is tucked into the hem on her left side. She pairs the tunic with loose, light blue pants. On her right wrist, she wears a blue scrunchie, and on her left wrist, a silver watch. The background includes lush green foliage with white flowers blooming on the trees, and the sky is overcast with a soft, diffused light. Power lines run diagonally across the sky, adding an urban touch to the natural setting.", "width": 1024, "height": 1024, "seed": 38736508, "faceDetailerSeed": 42103352, "upscaling_time": 27.557990789413452}
